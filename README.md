# Turtle-crossing-Game

This is turtle crossing game. You might've played Crossy Road. So this is a similar concept. We have a whole bunch of cars going across a super 

busy multi-lane highway and our turtle is the player who has to cross the road.

This is what the gameplay looks like.

The player controls the turtle which can only go forwards, and there's a whole bunch of randomly generated cars which are going horizontally across the screen. 

Now, once a player reaches the other side of the screen, the cars speed up, but the player goes back to the starting position, ready to cross the 

screen again. Now, at some point when the player turtle hits a car, the that game is over.
